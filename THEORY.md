# Skin Disease Detection System - Theory and Implementation

## 1. Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying various skin diseases from images. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained on a dataset of skin disease images.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Docker Implementation
Docker is used in this project for several important reasons:
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensures the same environment across development and deployment
- **Dependency Management**: Packages all required libraries and dependencies
- **Isolation**: Prevents conflicts with system-wide Python installations
- **Reproducibility**: Makes it easy to reproduce the exact environment
- **Deployment**: Simplifies deployment across different platforms

## 3. Data Pipeline

### 3.1 Dataset
The system uses a dataset containing images of various skin diseases. Key characteristics:
- Multiple disease categories
- High-resolution images
- Varied lighting conditions
- Different skin types and tones

### 3.2 Preprocessing Pipeline (preprocessing.py)
The preprocessing stage involves several steps:
1. **Image Loading**: Reading images from source directory
2. **Resizing**: Standardizing image dimensions to 128x128 pixels
3. **Normalization**: Converting pixel values to [0,1] range
4. **Data Augmentation**: 
   - Rotation (30 degrees)
   - Width/height shifts
   - Shear transformations
   - Zoom variations
   - Horizontal/vertical flips
   - Brightness adjustments
5. **Batch Processing**: Organizing data into manageable batches
6. **Label Encoding**: Converting disease names to numerical labels
